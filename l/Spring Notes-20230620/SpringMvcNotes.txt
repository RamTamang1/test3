Controller is the one who takes the client request and pass the request to the appropriate Model .

Model is responsible for all business logic and db operations.

View is responsible for rendering the processed data to the client.its total look of the application.

SpringMvc
----------
Using springMvc can develop Web application

Advantages of Spring MVC:
1) Using Spring MVC we can develop loosely coupled web applications.
2)Spring MVC has the in built Front Controller.
3) Validation and Exception Handling is simplified in Spring MVC.
4)Spring MVC has the capability to integrate with other Frameworks easily.
5)Using Spring MVC we can develop web applications and distributed applications also.
6)we can simply 118n

Spring Mvc module avilable in Spring FrameWork

In Spring 1.x version we have Spring Mvc and Spring WebMvc Modules

Spring 2.x version web Module and mvc Module are combined released 
spring web mvc Module.


Spring mvc module is used to develop below two types of applications

WebApplication
Distrubted applications

This Spring web mvc module is developed based on 2 design patterns
a)Mvc Design Pattern
b)Front Controller Design Pattern

Spring mvc Components?
========================
1)FrontController(DispatcherServlet)
2)Handler Mapper
3)Controller
4)ModelAndView
5)ViewResolver
6)View

FrontController
==================
==> FrontController is responsible to perform pre-processing and post-proessing of Incoming Request

   eg:   Capturing form data we can consider as pre-processing request
         sending response back to client is call post-processing of request.

In SpringWebMvc Based Application we will use DispatcherServlet as a FrontController
DispatcherServlet is a predefined servlet provided by SpringMvc Module
DispatcherServlet is a predefined Class it act as FrontController.

DisPatcherServlet can be perform pre-processing and post-processing operations.

HandlerMapper
=============
HandlerMapper is a predefined class avialble in SpringMvc

HandlerMapper takes the request coming from DispatcherServlet 
and Its Identify request Handler(Controller)

Handler Mapping will identify request Handler and Returns Details to DispatcherServlet.

The spring built in HandlerMappings
==================================
BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping
SimpleUrlHandlerMapping
ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping
CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping

Note : HandlerMapping is configured In SpringConfiguration file.

Note: No more declaration for the Handler Mapping from spring 3.x
like
BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping
SimpleUrlHandlerMapping
ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping
CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping
Instead of using all These Handler mappings 
All are replaced with a standard @RequestMapping annotation
If the @RequestMapping is applied at class level(can apply at method level for multi-actionscontroller)it required to put a RequestMethod to indicate which method to handle the mapping request

Controller
================

Controller is a program which is responsible to handler the request

-->In spring Mvc Module we can create our own Controllers.

Controller takes the request from Dispatcher Servlet and process the Request...

And gives response back to DispatcherServlet in the form of ModelAndView Object.

Controller/Handler classes are act as helperclasses to  interact with Model component...

In SpringMvc Module hving Predefined Controller classes are avilable
Controller(I)
AbstractCommandController(c)
SimpleFormController(c)
WizardFormController(c)
MultiActionController(c)

These are outdated no one is not using , 3.x onwards @Controller Annotation

--> We can create User define controller using @Controller Annotation

ModelAndview
=============
Once Request Processing is completed Controller will return ModelAndView Object
to DispatcherServlet

ModelAndView is pre-defined Class avilable in springMvc Module

ModelAndview class ,Model reporesents data and view represents logicalviewname
Model --> Holds Data
View ---> Logical ViewFileName


ViewResolver
============
ViewResolver is predefined classes avilable on springmvc
These viewResponse are resonsible to identify viewFiles(Location and Extension)




The ViewResolver object is responsible to locate the view object
that can render a view for this request.
The DispatcherServlet uses the ViewResolver to resolve the logicalview name described by the ModelAndView Object to locate the view Object.
Spring provides various built-in ViewResolver implementations that meet most of our requirement in locating the view The most commonly used Spring provided built-in viewResolver implementations are...
UrlBasedViewResolver
IntenalResourceViewResolver
ResourceBundleViewResolver
BeanNameViewResolver
XmlViewResolver
Each one of these viewResolver implementations presents  a unique way to transform the logical view name to view objects capable of rendering the view for the request.


RequestExecution Flow In SpringMvc Application
================================================

1)DispatcherServlet takes the request Coming From client .
DispatcherServlet is predefined Class it act as Frontcontroller.

2)DispatcherServlet will send required Url to HanderMapper
or
DispatcherServlet gives the request to Handlermapper
3)
HandlerMapper will identify reuqestHandler(controller) which is responsible to handle the request and will send request handler details to DispatcherServlet

or

HandlerMapper takes the reuqest From DispatcherServlet ,It Identifies RequestHandler and 
gives the response back to DispatcherServlet

4) DispatcherServlet  gives the request to Contoller
5)Controller  will process request and will send ModelAndView object to DispatcherServlet
Model-->Data
view -->logical filename

6)DispatcherServlet send view Name to ViewResolver
7)ViewResolver will identify  view location and extension details to DispatcherServlet
8)DispatcherSerlvet will give Model and View details to view Component
9)Model data will be rendered on view sends back to DispatcherServlet
10)DispatcherServlet will send response back to a client
