Spring MVC Framework provides Model View Controller Architecture and used  to develope loosely coupled web applications.The MVC architecture used to divide the whole application into parts i.e Model,View and Controller.


Controller is the one who takes the client request and pass the request to the appropriate Model .

Model is responsible for all business logic and db operations.

View is responsible for rendering the processed data to the client.its total look of the application.

Advantages of Spring MVC:
1) Using Spring MVC we can develop loosely coupled web applications.
2)Spring MVC has the in built Front Controller.
3) Validation and Exception Handling is simplified in Spring MVC.
4)Spring MVC has the capability to integrate with other Frameworks easily.
5)Using Spring MVC we can develop web applications and distributed applications also.

Dispatcher-Servlet:

Dispatcher-Servlet is a Front Controller and it is a built-in Controller class- is responsible for handling client request and dispatches the request to appropriate controller.




Spring is a frame work s/w to simplify Java/j2ee Related applications 
SpringWebMvc
===============
To Simplify WebDevelopment.

Advantages Of Mvc
=====================
1)Clean separation of responsibilities
(clear separation between presentation logic and application logic and dataAccess logic)
2)Code reusability
3)Single point entry for the application.
4)Easy for maintain and future enhancements.
5)Parallel development
6)Supports multiple view technlogies.
Drawbacks of Mvc
===================
Increased Complexity to implement Controlling logic.
2)Implementing single point of entry (Controller)is difficult.
So Using Mvc Implemented framework is advisable.,The popular Mvc Implemented webapplication framework.

What is the purpose of SpringMvc?
SpringMvc(SpringSource) module designed based on Mvc Design pattern to simplify webapplicationdevelopment.
Spring mvc is meant for making webapplication devleopement faster,cost-effective,and flexible.
What are the java technlogies used in spring applciation?
Servlet
Jsp
JavaBean

Advantage of SpringMvc Framework
=====================================
Clear Separation of responsiblities.bcz it implements mvc design pattern...
Loose coupling among Mode,view and Controller.
In-Built from Controller...
Validation impletation is simplified.
User input is avialble in the object orieneted format.
Internationalzation logic is simplifed.
Spring mvc provides custom jsp tags,which are useful to implement presentation logic
Spring can integrate with other webFramework like struts,webwork....
Integration with other view Technologies like velocity,freemarket,excel,pdf...


Controller
============
is a interface.

useing this we can interact Model Component.

HandlerMapping
==================
The HandlerMapping is responsible for mapping the incoming request to the handler that can handle the request.
When the DispatcherServlet receives the request It delegates the request to the HandlerMapping.Which Identifies the appropiate HandlerExecutionChain that can handle the request.
Handlermapping is a Interface The Spring f/w providing built-in HandlerMapping implementationsare
1)BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping
2)SimpleUrlHandlerMapping
3)ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping
4)CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping.
